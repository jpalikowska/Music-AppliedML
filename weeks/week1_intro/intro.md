## ✅ Course Goals

- **Get hands-on experience with real data and Machine Learning (ML) pipelines.**\
We'll work with simple yet practical examples of real-world ML problems.
- **Connect practice back to the math 💀 (when possible).**\
We'll stay in touch with the math that helps explain why some practical approached do — or don’t — work.
- **Learn essential Python tools for machine learning.**\
The emphasis is on implementing ML methods from scratch, but we'll also use essential ML libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.
- **Have fun!**
